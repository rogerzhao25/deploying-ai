While tools like ChatGPT are widely adopted—over 80% of organizations have explored or piloted them—their impact is primarily on individual productivity rather than organizational performance. Analysis of over 300 public AI implementations reveals key patterns: limited disruption across most industries, a paradox where larger firms lead in pilot volume but struggle with successful scale-ups, and a persistent bias in investments favoring visible marketing functions over back-office automation, which often yields better ROI. The report identifies a significant learning gap as the main barrier to successful GenAI integration, with current systems lacking the ability to adapt and learn over time. Organizations that thrive in this landscape typically forge strategic partnerships, customize solutions closely aligned with their workflows, and emphasize systems that improve through feedback. The most successful organizations leverage these principles to achieve measurable RO\n",
